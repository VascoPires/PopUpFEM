# PopUpBoxesFEM : Automated Abaqus/Python model generation for jumping cubes

### Introduction
Poping boxes is a project developed using Abaqus/Python scripting, in order to simulate the behavior of origami like folded boxes, with a rubber band attached. This is commonly known as Pop Jumping Cubes, and there are a lot of videos on Youtube on how to make them yourself.

Examples:

-  [Pop up Cubes in a box Tutorial - From Srushti Patil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3P-WZ2uPx0&t)

This project was initially conceived as a "Kitchen Mechanics" project using Abaqus Python scripting, which was challenged to me by Martin Pletz in the
